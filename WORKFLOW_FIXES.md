# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Continuous-Deployment Job Timeout (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: The job was using `runs-on: self-hosted` and waiting for 24 hours for a runner that wasn't available.
**Solution**: Changed to `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` to use GitHub-hosted runners that are always available.

### 2. Deprecated `set-output` Command (WARNING)
**Problem**: The workflow was using the deprecated `echo "::set-output name=..."` syntax.
**Solution**: Replaced with the new environment files approach: `echo "image=$VALUE" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT`

### 3. Docker Password Not Masked (SECURITY)
**Problem**: Using old ECR login action v1 that didn't properly mask Docker credentials.
**Solution**: Updated to `aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2` which properly handles credential masking.

### 4. Outdated GitHub Actions (MAINTENANCE)
**Problem**: Multiple actions were using outdated versions.
**Solution**: Updated all actions to their latest stable versions:
- `actions/checkout@v2` → `actions/checkout@v4`
- `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1` → `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4`
- `aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1` → `aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2`

## Additional Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Workflow Configuration
- Added `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual workflow execution
- Added global environment variables for better organization
- Added descriptive workflow name

### 2. Better Docker Image Management
- Added commit SHA tagging in addition to `latest` tag for better traceability
- Added proper container naming and restart policies
- Added container cleanup before new deployment

### 3. Improved Error Handling and Verification
- Added `continue-on-error: true` for container cleanup steps
- Added deployment verification with health checks
- Added proper multi-line formatting for better readability

### 4. Security Enhancements
- Added `environment: production` for deployment protection
- Added `mask-aws-account-id: false` for better transparency
- Properly structured environment variable passing

## Testing the Fixes

The workflow has been updated to address all identified issues:

1. ✅ **Timeout Issue**: Now uses GitHub-hosted runners instead of self-hosted
2. ✅ **Deprecated Commands**: Uses new `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` environment file approach
3. ✅ **Security Warnings**: Uses latest ECR login action with proper credential masking
4. ✅ **Action Versions**: All actions updated to latest stable versions

## Deployment Notes

- The workflow now includes better container management with named containers
- Health checks ensure the application is running correctly after deployment
- The deployment job now has environment protection for added security

## Breaking Changes

None - all changes are backward compatible and improve the existing workflow without changing its core functionality.
